\section{Contents}
After establishing the necessary mathematics, it is good to give the methodology some thought before committing to start coding. This is important as some of the structuring of the data and the program flow will be a lot of work to change later down the line. 

This work package contains detailed descriptions of the methodology for the thesis work. The contents are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Concepts for metrics and data structuring.
 \item A note on parallelization
 \item Numerical methods
 \item Extended Kalman filter
 \item Dense neural network
 \item Recurrrent neural network
\end{itemize}
