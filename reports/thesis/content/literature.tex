\chapter{Summary of the Literature Study}

Before starting the thesis work, a thorough literature study was conducted. This literature study was concerned primarily with identification of the knowledge gap and the methods that might be used to resolve such a gap. The three main areas that will be adressed here are: The population of near-Earth asteroids, listing the physical properties of the target asteroids as well as their orbital distributions; the underlying fundamentals of optics, used for modelling the observations, as well as the techniques available for processing these observations; and lastly the various methods which will be researched in this thesis. For the sake of conciseness, only a cursory overview is provided here. In case more background information is required, the reader is recommended to refer to the literature review [??
