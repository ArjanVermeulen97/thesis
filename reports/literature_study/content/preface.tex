\chapter{Preface}

What started as a concept in researching the feasibility of deflecting asteroids using hypervelocity impacts, has evolved into a proposal of using simulations to calculate trajectories and assess the risk of those asteroids in the first place. Undoubtedly a challenge, and one that has cost me plenty of thought on whether these methods are actually possible; a neural network or a Kalman filter is a cool concept, but \textit{how} can we apply it to this problem, given the many constraints? Add to that the competition of observational beasts such as the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the challenge has been set. Nevertheless, I am excited about the next steps in testing my thoughts, and my gratitude goes out to Dr. Jian Guo, who through his supervision has frequently challenged my ideas and assertions, feeding the thought processes leading to these conclusion. On to the next step?\\
